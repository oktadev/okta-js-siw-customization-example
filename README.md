## Getting Started

To use this example customization:

### Configure Your Custom Domain

Before you begin, you must configure your Okta org to use your custom domain. Custom domains enable code customizations, allowing you to style more than just the default logo, background, favicon, and two colors.

1. Sign in to your Okta Admin Console
2. Navigate to **Customizations > Brands** and select **Create Brand +**
3. Follow the [Customize domain and email](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/custom-url-domain/main/) developer docs to set up your custom domain on the new brand

Follow the instructions in the `README.md` for each directory of code examples.
